CP3 Book by Steven Halim - Codes And Solutions

Hi everyone, 
I'm feeling like putting efford into Competitive Programming again!. That's why I'm creating this Repository to grind the well-known book "Competitive Programming 3" - Steven Halim & Felix Halim from National University of Singapore. 

- I'm not that good of a coder, but hope that I will get a lot out from this book. 

Those codes that I uploaded will include C++ and maybe Java as well, the book recommend solving in Java sometimes because of it's powerful built-in libraries.

- For the Books' download, I won't publish them. Still, they are all over the internet if you want to find.

# Review about first chapter
- No kidding, the book's content is actually hard, the authors seem to expect readers to have known most of the basic algorithmms; they do recommend "Introduction to Algorithms" as basic knowledge. Plus, it looks like the book is more about the implementing algorithms and data structures than explaining them. 

- Guess what! ll try grinding "Introduction to Algorithms" along this book as well. 

# Code Personality =)
The CP3 book provides somewhat ugly codes throughout the book. Actually, they are not ugly, but the code will be very hard to read, thanks to the new edition, more comments were added into the books.

-- With my code, it will be very less comments, however, I write easily read code, there will be comments for only complex implements.
